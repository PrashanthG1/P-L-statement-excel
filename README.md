- **Conditional Formatting**:  
  - Applied rules to highlight trends, anomalies, and significant growth or declines in performance.  

- **Functional Enhancements**:  
  - Used **XLOOKUP** for efficient data retrieval and improved functionality.  
  - Created **Pivot Tables** for data aggregation and summarization.
